![Norbert](img/norbert.white.384px.png)

.. is the name of my own **quantum computation _A.I._**, which I'm working on for many, many years now.
_It's named by my father, *who passed away too soon..*_

# History
To be exact: I started with a communication protocol in \~2005. Then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's biological neural network (refractory period, etc. ;)~ .. **then** I came to the
`Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's own time(s) and space(s) [powered by quantum mechanics].. and which
uses these instead of the commonly used weights.. all in cartesian abstraction. ;)~

*Maybe* I'm not going to publish it when it's 'done', it's just for you to know that there'll be a `Norbert`
'[somewhere around (nothing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFL34Anl1d4)'! x)~

## Status
My technique? **Quantum Fields**, combined with a bit of **String** (Rotation) **Theory**. :-)

### Update
With the next **minor** version update (currently **v2.2.7.7** @ **2024-10-07**) everything
should be ready.

Last part is the `crawler` for text/code/.. input and the conversion scripts for media input
(so audio and video, mostly).

The `console` base is working great right now, so I'm **already** able to give my Norbert
some input data to think about (can also be pipe'd. Great for `ffmpeg`, and many other use cases).

### Example screenshot
Also visible: not all of my **profiles**, to (e.g..) easily decide the parameters for each data
via using another network port per input (my processors are all socket based).

## Research
Parts of my research work and some thesis, etc. at [mnemonics.de](https://mnemonics.de/).

Just quickly written down, and partially not the current state; it was just for your info, what's my
philosophy about nature and more.. just opinions (which I'll update in the future). ;)~
