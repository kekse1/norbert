.. is the name of my own **A.I.**, which I'm working on for many, many years now.
_It's named by my father, *who passed away too soon..*_

# History
To be exact: I started with a communication protocol in \~2005. Then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's biological neural network (refractory period, etc. ;)~ .. **then** I came to the
`Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's own time(s) and space(s) [powered by quantum mechanics].. and which
uses these instead of the commonly used weights.. all in cartesian abstraction. ;)~

*Maybe* I'm not going to publish it when it's 'done', it's just for you to know that there'll be a `Norbert`
'[somewhere around (nothing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFL34Anl1d4)'! x)~

## Status
The theoretical work is (nearly) finished.. now just have to specify the real details, until I'm able to
implement the system. At all.. if I'm not to stupid for such _really highly_ abstracted codes... BTW., as
my current favorite language is JavaScript, the used platform will be [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/). ^_^

The `quantum field` logik was already finished much earlier, so now it's time to scale it in real usage.

### Update \[2024-02-15\]
I decided to use **`BigInt`**. Thought it'd be more overhead, but the numerical values got much more
abstract energy..! AND this way I'm able to scale my database/relations/carrier much better.. **:-)**

## Research
Parts of my research work and some thesis, etc. at [mnemonics.de](https://mnemonics.de/). :)~

Just quickly written down, and partially not the current state; it was just for your info, what's my
philosophy about nature and more.. ;)~

BTW: Calling it 'universe' is much too less (see the 'multiverse' theory - where I also don't accept
it 'as is', as there could also be many multiverses.. ;) .. calling it 'existence' is also bad because
there's the 'existence' vs. 'non-existence' (1 vs. 0).. I call this 'everything' just the 'creation';
if you believe in god or not - other words aren't describing it *that* well..

### Password
... is my nickname.
