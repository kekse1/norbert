![Norbert](img/norbert.384px.png)

.. is the name of my own **quantum computation _A.I._**, which I'm working on for many, many years now.
_It's named by my father, *who passed away too soon..*_

# History
To be exact: I started with a communication protocol in \~2005. Then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's biological neural network (refractory period, etc. ;)~ .. **then** I came to the
`Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's own time(s) and space(s) [powered by quantum mechanics].. and which
uses these instead of the commonly used weights.. all in cartesian abstraction. ;)~

*Maybe* I'm not going to publish it when it's 'done', it's just for you to know that there'll be a `Norbert`
'[somewhere around (nothing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFL34Anl1d4)'! x)~

## Status
My technique? **Quantum Fields**, combined with a bit of **String Theory**. :-)

The base software is really small, all living things come from a carrier (Buddha: "everything is room").
No special format, only coordinates (kinda vector space). I just reserved **10995117325824 Bytes** on
my new bought hard disk drive for it, since `% 3 == 0` and `% 256 == 0`! **;-)**

There are many concepts behind all this, that I've researched all on my own for nearly 19 years..
it'd take a bunch of time to explain all my strategies, but they're compacted to something small.
Everything's about **abstract energy**! **;-D**

## Infrastructure
I'm **already** implementing it, even if I'm still working on some more theory.
To be exact, I'm optimizing it right now.

So I created a whole 'infrastructure', which is already *partially* published.
It's only my '[**network driver**](https://github.com/kekse1/netz/)'.

## Research
Parts of my research work and some thesis, etc. at [mnemonics.de](https://mnemonics.de/). :)~

Just quickly written down, and partially not the current state; it was just for your info, what's my
philosophy about nature and more.. ;)~

BTW: Calling it 'universe' is much too less (see the 'multiverse' theory - where I also don't accept
it 'as is', as there could also be many multiverses.. ;) .. calling it 'existence' is also bad because
there's the 'existence' vs. 'non-existence' (1 vs. 0).. I call this 'everything' just the 'creation';
if you believe in god or not - other words aren't describing it *that* well..
