![Norbert](img/logo/norbert.white.384px.png)

.. is the name of my own **quantum computation _A.I._**, which I'm working on for many, many years now.
_It's named by my father, *who passed away too soon..*_

> What I cannot create, I do not understand â€” Richard Feynman.

# History
To be exact: I started with a communication protocol in \~2005. Then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's biological neural network (refractory period, etc. ;)~ .. **then** I came to the
`Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's own time(s) and space(s) [powered by quantum mechanics].. and which
uses these instead of the commonly used weights.. all in cartesian abstraction. ;)~

*Maybe* I'm not going to publish it when it's 'done', it's just for you to know that there'll be a `Norbert`
'[somewhere around (nothing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFL34Anl1d4)'! x)~

## Notes
My technique? **Quantum Fields**, combined with a bit of **String** (Rotation) **Theory**. And the most
important operation is the **NOT**, btw. It's responsible for many (also emergent) features - and is
implemented in multiple 'layers', each in another 'look'.

Additionally, now it doesn't work only with BigInt, but also with regular integers. Now it will run
both features in parallel. The input (which happens **abstract** => the **best**!) is not only every
input byte (I'm **not** working with tokens or smth. like that.. pure **byte**code /**256**),
but also each last output, so there's a real **feedback** (so the information is (also) self organizing).

Virtuality is also best performing.. so this peace of software doesn't act with much neuron class
instances or smth. similar, but only with digits in kinda vector space.

> [!TIP]
> The 'number' (also called 'figure') is a geometrical thing. ... ;-)

### Example screenshot(s)
Also visible: not all of my **profiles**, to (e.g..) easily decide the parameters for each data
via using another network port per input (my processors are all socket based).

And this is one of some more learning methods/functions (here from a directory).

## Research
Parts of my research work and some thesis, etc. at [mnemonics.de](https://mnemonics.de/).

Just quickly written down, and partially not the current state; it was just for your info, what's my
philosophy about nature and more.. just opinions (which I'll update in the future). ;)~
