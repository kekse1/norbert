![Norbert](img/norbert.white.384px.png)

.. is the name of my own **quantum computation _A.I._**, which I'm working on for many, many years now.
_It's named by my father, *who passed away too soon..*_

# History
To be exact: I started with a communication protocol in \~2005. Then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's biological neural network (refractory period, etc. ;)~ .. **then** I came to the
`Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's own time(s) and space(s) [powered by quantum mechanics].. and which
uses these instead of the commonly used weights.. all in cartesian abstraction. ;)~

*Maybe* I'm not going to publish it when it's 'done', it's just for you to know that there'll be a `Norbert`
'[somewhere around (nothing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFL34Anl1d4)'! x)~

## Status
My technique? **Quantum Fields**, combined with a bit of **String** (Rotation) **Theory**. :-)

### Update (**2024-09-09**)
It's nearly finished.. currently **v2.1.6.2** (**2024-09-10**).

### First Screenshot
There's still some things **TODO**, mostly in the **interface** itself;
the real base (data structures and algorithms) are _nearly_ **finished**. **:-)**

## Research
Parts of my research work and some thesis, etc. at [mnemonics.de](https://mnemonics.de/).

Just quickly written down, and partially not the current state; it was just for your info, what's my
philosophy about nature and more.. just opinions (which I'll update in the future). ;)~
