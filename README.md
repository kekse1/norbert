# `Norbert`
.. is the name of my own AI, which I'm working on for many, many years now.

To be exactly: I started with a communication protocol in ~2005, then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's neural network, etc.. until I came to the `Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's
own time and space (powered by quantum mechanics)..

It's named by my father, who left us too early. And I'm not going to publish it when it's 'ready', it's
just for you to know that there'll be a 'Norbert' somewhere around.. x)~
