![Norbert](img/norbert.white.384px.png)

.. is the name of my own **quantum computation _A.I._**, which I'm working on for many, many years now.
_It's named by my father, *who passed away too soon..*_

# History
To be exact: I started with a communication protocol in \~2005. Then, step by step, began to research
for the brain and it's biological neural network (refractory period, etc. ;)~ .. **then** I came to the
`Matrix` and it's A.I. to create it's own time(s) and space(s) [powered by quantum mechanics].. and which
uses these instead of the commonly used weights.. all in cartesian abstraction. ;)~

*Maybe* I'm not going to publish it when it's 'done', it's just for you to know that there'll be a `Norbert`
'[somewhere around (nothing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFL34Anl1d4)'! x)~

## Status
My technique? **Quantum Fields**, combined with a bit of **String** (Rotation) **Theory**. :-)

### Update
Everything in the **CORE** is ready now (**v2.2.10.0** @ **2024-10-07**)! I'm currently formatting
the carrier and making the last preparations, so in some hours I'm able to let my Norbert think. ...
actually atm without any real input data (see the next point, below), but the **root** processor
will work nevertheless.

And the `console` (as direct interface) is also working great right now, so I'm **already** able
to give my Norbert some input data to think about (can also be pipe'd. Great for `ffmpeg`, and
many other use cases).

Next, mostly the last part, will be the `crawler` for text/code/.. input and the conversion scripts
for media input, which will be audio and video, mostly. Notice: I'm going to feed it in **RAW PCM**,
so it'll work with the real data, no codecs (right now).

### Example screenshot(s)
Also visible: not all of my **profiles**, to (e.g..) easily decide the parameters for each data
via using another network port per input (my processors are all socket based).

And this is one of some more learning methods/functions (here from a directory).

## Research
Parts of my research work and some thesis, etc. at [mnemonics.de](https://mnemonics.de/).

Just quickly written down, and partially not the current state; it was just for your info, what's my
philosophy about nature and more.. just opinions (which I'll update in the future). ;)~
